## Overview
This project utilizes the Airbnb dataset to provide insights for individuals interested in starting an Airbnb business. The primary use case is to determine the optimal location for purchasing a property to be listed on Airbnb in order to maximize profits.

## Visualization Techniques
- Price by Zip code
- Map view for each zipcode with its price
- Best time to put a property in Airbnb (week-wise and month-wise)
- Number of Bedrooms vs Price

## Insights
- The visualization of price by zip code and map view allows potential property buyers to identify areas with the highest profitability.
- The best time to list a property on Airbnb, both on a weekly and monthly basis, aids in strategic decision-making for property owners.
- The relationship between the number of bedrooms and the property price offers valuable information to property owners, indicating that properties with one bedroom tend to generate higher business compared to others.

## Usage
This project can be used by individuals interested in starting an Airbnb business to gain crucial insights for potential property buyers and owners. The visual representations and insights provided can aid in strategic decision-making for property purchase, listing timing, and pricing strategies, ultimately maximizing potential profits in the competitive Airbnb market.
